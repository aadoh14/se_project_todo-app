# Simple Todo App

A simple and interactive Todo application that allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. Users can also set due dates for their todos and manage their daily tasks efficiently through an intuitive interface.

## Functionality

This Todo app enables users to efficiently manage their daily tasks. Users can add new tasks with a name and an optional due date, mark tasks as completed or uncompleted using a checkbox, and delete tasks when they are no longer needed. The app visually distinguishes completed tasks and displays due dates in a user-friendly format.

## Technology

The interface is styled with CSS for a clean and responsive user experience. HTML5 is used for structuring the app, including the use of semantic elements and templates. The app features modular JavaScript classes for tasks and form validation, ensuring maintainable and scalable code.
